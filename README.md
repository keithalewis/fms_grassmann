# Grassmann Algebra

Hermann Grassmann invented a geometric algebra involving points in space.
Let _E_ be the set of points in _n_-dimensional space and define
𝒢(_E_) to be the smallest algebra over the real numbers with the
rule _P_ ​_Q_ = 0 if and only if _P_ = _Q_ for _P_, _Q_ in _E_.
Note 0 = (_P_ + _Q_)(_P_ + _Q_) = _P_ _Q_ + _Q_ _P_ so
_P_ _Q_ = -_Q_ _P_.
